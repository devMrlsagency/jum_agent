'''Development agent responsible for generating code.

The `DevAgent` uses a language model to translate a high-level task plan into
concrete code. In a production system you would craft detailed prompts
describing your coding guidelines and the target language. For now, this
agent uses a simple instruction and returns the response from the model.
